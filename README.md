### 2) Map plots
- t2m_ERA5.pdf shows the climatological mean 2 meter temperature from 1970 to 2014 of the ERA5-model
- t2m_models.pdf shows the climatological mean 2 meter temperature 1970-2014 of the selected CMIP6-models
- Differences_models.pdf shows the differences in temperatures of the ERA5 and the selected CMIP6-models
- Bias.pdf shows the bias of the differences of the temperatures (ERA5 vs selected CMIP6-models)
